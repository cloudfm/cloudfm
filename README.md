### Hacking

We use the [Nix](http://nixos.org/nix/) package manager for development, so make
sure you grab it first. Then, switch to the project folder and type:

    nix-shell .

This will put you in a shell with all dependencies available. There are also a
few new commands: `build`, `run` and `test`.
